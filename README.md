### Tokenomics of Web3 infrastructure networks 

The paper covers the first part focused on network level rewards to incentivize the supply-side of Web3 infrastructure networks. An article-format summarizing it is here: https://mirror.xyz/1kx.eth/YWTZJO853QePwPUPka1aG4HXDT6hvqKnunG7fDe06Yg

Each analysed network hs a folder with more information around sources and data used for the analysis (plus some additional data beyond what is covered in the paper/article) - We are still in the process of uploading all those.

We anyway will continously update those folders as we continue the research around further aspects on tokenomics. Feel free to reach out to @KoschigRobert on Twitter for questions and comments.
